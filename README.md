To start the project just do npm run build and go to http://localhost:8888/ in your browser.

package.json 

    I have add Ant Design dependency.
    I use the Babel preset '@babel/preset-env' because is my default go to, but I could have also used the react one.


webpack.config.js 

    I have congiured the webpack so that it can bundle all js into a single js file. Also, I included the necessary libraries to read css files and images, so that they could be also imported.
